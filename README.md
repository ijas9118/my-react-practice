# ReactQuest: Frontend Machine Coding Challenges

Welcome to **ReactQuest**, a personal project documenting my journey to master frontend development through hands-on machine coding challenges.

- This repository contains a collection of React-based coding challenges, each with interactive solutions you can try out and explore.
- Built with **React**, **Vite**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this project showcases my progress in solving react machine code interview questions.

The source code for each solution is available in this repository, and you can checkout the challenges live on the [ReactQuest website](https://my-react-practice-theta.vercel.app/)

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building reusable UI components.
- **Vite**: For a fast development environment and optimized builds.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, responsive, and minimal styling.
- **pnpm**: For efficient package management.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing.
- **Lucide React**: For lightweight, customizable icons.
